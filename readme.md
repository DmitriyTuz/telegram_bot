2) npm install - for connecting modules

3) npm run dev - for run

4) find in Telegram BotFather in Search and click, then click 'Start'
5) click reference '/newbot', then input name of your bot (for example - DimBot111),
then input username for your bot, it must end in 'bot' (for example - DimBot111bot).

variable in the 'index.js' file to the received one. Then click in telegram reference 
't.me/DimBot111bot' and then click 'Start'. 

6) now you have 3 commands in telegram: '/start', '/info' and '/game'
 - '/start' for start bot;
 - '/info' for some information
 - '/game' for game 'guess the number that the bot guessed'
